## COVID-19 Data Exploration Script

This script empowers you to delve into COVID-19 data stored within the `CovidPortfolioProject` schema. It leverages the power of SQL queries to analyze various facets of the pandemic, including:

* **Basic Statistics:** Gain a foundational understanding with general information on deaths, cases, and population.
* **Death Rates:** Calculate the death rate for each location by dividing total deaths by total cases.
* **Infection Rates:** Estimate the percentage of the population infected by dividing total cases by population.
* **Hotspot Identification:** Locate areas with the highest infection and death rates relative to their population size.
* **Continental Analysis:** Analyze death rates grouped by continent to identify global trends.
* **Global Numbers:** Calculate global totals for new cases, deaths, and the overall death rate.
* **Vaccination Analysis:** By joining data from a vaccination table, this script calculates:
    * The rolling number of people vaccinated in each location.
    * The percentage of the population vaccinated (demonstrated using CTE, Temporary Table, and View approaches).

**Requirements:**

* Access to a database server containing the `CovidPortfolioProject` schema.

**Instructions:**

1. **Copy and Paste:** Simply copy and paste the script into your SQL query editor.
2. **Connection Details:** Link to DataSet and download full data(CSV), open it with excel then import data to ssms 
3. **Explore the Data:** Execute the queries one by one to uncover insights from the data.

**Notes:**

* The script assumes the data quality adheres to the `CovidPortfolioProject` schema.
* Some queries filter for locations containing "%states%", potentially limiting the analysis to specific regions. You can modify this filter for a broader scope.
* The vaccination analysis calculates the rolling total but doesn't explicitly calculate the vaccination rate (percentage vaccinated per day). You can add calculations for this metric.
* Consider incorporating comments throughout the script for enhanced readability and future maintenance.

This script serves as a springboard for exploring and comprehending COVID-19 data stored in relational databases. Feel free to modify and extend it to conduct further analysis aligned with your specific needs.

**Additional Information:**

* This script utilizes advanced SQL concepts like joins, Common Table Expressions (CTEs), temporary tables, and views to manipulate and analyze data effectively.
* Don't hesitate to adjust the script to explore different aspects of the data or answer specific questions you may have.
